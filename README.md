## 🌀 Fluid Simulation (SPH) in Python

A real-time fluid simulation built from scratch in Python using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Pygame.
This project explores how complex fluid behavior like water, gas, and solid-like motion can emerge from simple particle interactions driven by real physics.
